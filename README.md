# BoomBike_LinearRegression
> Assignment
Problem Statement:
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:-
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
Essentially, the company wants â€”
To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.
So interpretation is important!

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project? 
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve? Trying to build a model that could predict the demand on day to day basis, so that the company can anticipate the demand.
- What is the dataset that is being used? day.csv, this was provided and is not included in this repository

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We have initialy built a model with 13 features.
- Later on optimised it and built the model with 10 features
- This model shows a good fit in predicting the demand for bike rental
